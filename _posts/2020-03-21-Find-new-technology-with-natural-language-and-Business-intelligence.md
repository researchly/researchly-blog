*This post shows how to use Researchly to discover new technology using natural language and Business intelligence.*

To discover new technology, you must first define what it should do. Given the current COVID–19 spread, let’s use ‘detect a virus’. The easiest way to find technologies that can ‘detect a virus’ is [Researchly's Knowledge Graph](https://www.researchly.app/analytics/knowledgegraph?utm_source=528547e2&utm_medium=88682ffa&utm_campaign=edfcaff2). You can query the Knowledge Graph with human-readable sentences. In this case: ‘How to detect a virus?’

As we can see, several technologies can detect a virus. Let’s pick one technology and explore it further. I have selected RT-PCR.


First, what is RT-PCR? According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction?utm_source=528547e2&utm_medium=88682ffa&utm_campaign=edfcaff2){:target="_blank"}:


> Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA (in this context called complementary DNA or cDNA) and amplification of specific DNA targets using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It is primarily used to measure the amount of a specific RNA. This is achieved by monitoring the amplification reaction using fluorescence, a technique called real-time PCR or quantitative PCR (qPCR). Combined RT-PCR and qPCR are routinely used for analysis of gene expression and quantification of viral RNA in research and clinical settings.

Whereas this explanation is relevant, it is even more interesting to see which applications exist with RT-PCR.

## Understand a technology’s applications with the Relationship Map

To answer that, we can use [Researchly’s Relationship Map](https://www.researchly.app/analytics/relationship_map?utm_source=528547e2&utm_medium=88682ffa&utm_campaign=edfcaff2). This map shows all ‘actions’ that a technology can do. Additionally, it shows the target of that action. This information is extracted from patents and Wikipedia.
In the case of RT-PCR, we see that all applications focus on 'detect'.

When we zoom in, we see what RT-PCR can detect; different viruses.

At this point we know what RT-PCR is and what its capabilities are. However, a technology’s capabilities do not fully describe it. Another important aspect are properties. In the case of shoes properties are the material or the shape.


## Use the Technology Radar to discover a technology’s properties
To see a technology’s properties, we can use Researchly’s Technology Radar. The [Technology Radar](https://www.researchly.app/analytics/technologyradar?utm_source=528547e2&utm_medium=88682ffa&utm_campaign=edfcaff2) shows technological hotspots and vacuums. For that, it extracts a technology’s properties and measures the amount of research and applications for each property. This information is extracted from Wikipedia and patents.
For RT-PCR the Technology Radar shows that a lot of research and applications revolve around the ‘fluorescent’ aspect and the magnitude of RT-PCR (double, triple , etc.)

Finally, if you want to know even more about RT-PCR, Researchly offers two more features:

- **[Technology Roadmap](https://www.researchly.app/analytics/technologyroadmap?utm_source=528547e2&utm_medium=88682ffa&utm_campaign=edfcaff2)** to see RT-PCR’s major milestones
- **[Technology Network](https://www.researchly.app/analytics/technologynetwork?utm_source=528547e2&utm_medium=88682ffa&utm_campaign=edfcaff2)** to see how RT-PCR converges with other technologies


I will cover those features in my next article. If you do not want to wait, you can try them yourself [here](https://www.researchly.app/analytics/dashboard?utm_source=528547e2&utm_medium=88682ffa&utm_campaign=edfcaff2). It is free.
