# Topic overview
Companies involved with AI/ML are associated with Analytics & BI, Cloud Computing, concrete AI/ML-applications, and AM/ML-development.

## Deep dive into the AI/ML-applications cluster
Within the **AI/ML-applications cluster**, Automated Machine Learning is the most frequent topic and the most central one. The relations to other big topics like NLP and CV further emphasize the potential for Auto ML.

The presence of Open Source as an own cluster indicates that even huge companies like Amazon cannot (yet) succeed on their own.

## Deep dive into the AM/ML-development cluster
Getting the data (training/inference or data labeling) is more important than building/modeling models. Big players like Amazon are reacting accordingly.

Besides the need for data (training/inference or data labeling), deploying the finished models is difficult, indicating a need for MLOps.

## Company strategies and profiles
As indicated by the trend towards open source, companies are well connected.

However, commercial companies dominate the news landscape.

Although a lot of companies exist, only a few dominate the landscape.

# Although companies share topics, strategies are visible
<ul>
	<li>Alteryx’s analytics “legacy” is clearly visible</li>
	<li>Whereas Google seems to be more cloud-focused when it comes to AI/ML, Amazon is focusing on specific AI/ML applications.</li>
	<li>For IBM, security is a priority.</li>
	<li>Mathworks (company behind MATLAB and Simulink) focuses on AI and Hardware applications</li>
</ul>

# Industry trends: interaction of Analytics, enterprise AI (“advanced analytics”) and Big Data
Alteryx the publicly traded analytics company acquired ClearStory (automated Big Data processing) and Feature Labs (AutoAI solutions) emphasizing the trend towards a blend of analytics and (Auto)AI (“advanced analytics”) and the need for Big Data processing.

The relationship between Tableau and Alteryx emphasizing their partnership shows further that AI is blending more and more into reporting and visualization.

Finally, the relationship between Tableau and Salesforce reminds of Salesforce’s acquisition of Tableau and the potential it brings. It again shows the blend of visualization and AI (Salesforce’s Einstein Analytics offers “AI-powered advanced analytics”).

Similar to ClearStory, Feature Labs, Alteryx, Tableau, and Salesforce SAPs investment into DataRobot shows the industry shift towards enterprise AI.

# Startup situation: rising in the background but also falling
Young companies like Databricks (founded in 2013) and DataRobot (founded in2012) are becoming more entrenched.
However, the  startup-company dotscience (tool for tracking, deploying, and monitoring AI models) already had to close down.
