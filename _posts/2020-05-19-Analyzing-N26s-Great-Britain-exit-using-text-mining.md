*This report uses text mining to analyze 1700 news articles about N26 and Revolut to understand N26's Great Britain exit. It uses a network graph to show the relationship between an article and the topics that the article covers.*


N26, the German smartphone-bank entered Great Britain in 2018. In February of 2020, they exited Great Britain. Officially they exited Great Britain because of the regulatory issues regarding a new banking licensee.

Some analysts, among them Heinz-Roger Dohms believe that Brexit was not the only reason for N26's exit. Heinz-Roger Dohms assumes that besides regulatory challenges, another reason for N26s exit was their weak market position.

To examine N26's Great Britain exit, this report analysis 1700 news articles (published in German and English) about N26 and Revolut (one of the major competitors). It uses a network graph to show the relationship between an article and the topics that the article covers.
